Directory: `server`
Uses:
- Node
- Express
- TypeScript
- Jest + Supertest for testing

### Starting server

## Frontend:  React + TypeScript + Vite
Directory: `client`
Uses:
- Node
- React + Vite
- TypeScript
- Vitest + React Testing Library for testing

- User interactions
  - Does the submit button call `onSubmit()` when clicked?
